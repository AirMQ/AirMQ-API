# AirMQ-API #
AirMQ GraphQL Public API
### 1. Getting started ###
AirMQ API is based on GraphQL query language. It is different from the majority of RESTful APIs, yet it is more flexible and provides a lot of advanced features.

GraphQL is typically different from REST in that it:

* has single endpoint for all queries and operations
* uses http POST requests for both sending and getting data
* accepts JSON-like queries
* returns data only in JSON format

### 2. Authentication ###

### 3. Querying data ###

Complete documentation based on SpectaQL is [soon to be] available at https://api-docs.airmq.by
